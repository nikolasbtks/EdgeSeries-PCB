# EdgeSeries-PCB

## Description

This series ia a collection of custom development boards built for edge applications and embedded systems. Each board in the **EdgeSeries** is tailored for different use cases, while focusing on periphreal-rich design and usability.

## Series Boards

### EdgeMax
**EdgeMax** is powered by the **STM32H743ZIT6** microcontroller. It is designed for demanding edge embedded systems that require high performance and memory storage. This board ideal for applications where memory capacity is required.


### EdgeAir
**EdgeAir** is build around the **Renesas RA8M1** and **ESP32-S3R8** microcontroller. It is designed for IoT and edge systems with multiple peripheral interfaces, wireless connectivity and a small footprint.
(In progress)
